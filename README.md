Starting work with Open-CV 

Ensure that Python 3 is installed and i will prefer to Anaconda if you haven't installed yet bcz it provides Python along with Jupyter lab and notebook, which is prety easy and simple to use. It also provide Environment functionality which is very useful in case of when you need a specific ver of applications and library so you can work with specific verrsion in a invidual environment.
